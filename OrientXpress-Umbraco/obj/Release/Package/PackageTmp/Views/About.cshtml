                        OrientXpress started in 2006 when Han Jia and Michael Bain performed duo saxes together at Chinese Language School end of term functions. In 2009, they were joined by Luo Hui on keyboard and clarinet, then by Wang Hui (Emma) on vocals later the same year, then by Fujio Kano in 2011.
                        The group plays a selection of popular Chinese songs and western jazz, blues, and has performed at several public events and Chinese cultural events and house concert soirees in Wellington and charity concerts including the annual All Saints Concert at Otaki.
